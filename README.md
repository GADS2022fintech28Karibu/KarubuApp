Development Outline 
===Requirements

Login Fragments
- Administration
- Local users

Home Fragment
- Foods & prices
- Likes
NB: The food recycle view should be such that if selected, it opens a menu item for the user to enter the number of plates for that particular dish depending on the number of guest or the guest who will take that meal.

Basket Fragment
This fragment shows the users selections for the meal.
- Meals selected.
- The total prices.
NB: The total price should be a live data so that when a meal is added to the basket, it adds automatically.
This fragment should have a button that performs STK push. It means that once the total is tallied, the user clicks the button and he/she gets a prompt to enter the mpesa pin and the payment is done automatically.

Table selection Fragment
- We can have something like an image of seats that shows the seats that have not been booked and those that are already booked.
- We can make it such that the booked one are turned to grey color.

Booking details
- To ensure the booking is done properly we should have a fragment that shows the details of the booking.

Guest Fragments
- Here, we shows the guest arrival date and time.

For the admin
